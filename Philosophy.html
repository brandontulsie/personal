      <h2>Philosophical Beliefs</h2>
      <p>I'm a atheist, meaning I don't have an affiliation with an religious belief. I bear no ill feelings against any who is so affliated with any of the
      religious beliefs and respect their decision to do so. </p>
      <p>I believe it's never good to stagnate. One should always seek constant improvement even if you think you're at your limit push past those limits
      and see the new heights where it takes you.</p>
      <p>Verbiage is an important part in communicating and as such proper verbiage is perferred so others can better understand what it is you're
      trying to say. Incorrect or improper verbiage leads to confusion, confusion isn't a great thing to have when trying to talk to someone.</p>
      <p>I'm not someone who prides themself on winning and being the absolute best but rather i'm someone that hates losing. Giving up would be the ultimate
       form of loss, it shows complete defeat. Giving because someone is too difficult and constantly complaining, to me, means that you're now willing to get
        any better than you already are therefore stagnating.</p>
      <p>One should always be have positive mental attitude. A bit of negativity can go a long way and affect others greatly depending on their own personal
      situations and feelings. It is conatantly the case where one person starts complaing or even yelling that another person feels it right to also
      display such attitude. Keep in mind that your personal attitude can largely affect everyone around you whether it be good or bad.</p>
