      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>Hello, I'm Brandon Tulsie. Born on the eighteenth day of the nineth month in 1998 and at the current age of 19. <br>As a person I am umempathetic
        although I try to be as empathetic as I possibly can at times, but emotions are hard and this can lead to a lot of social awkwardness. It's
        not like I don't understand the concept behind each emotion its the fact that I can't personally feel them myself, so for the most part I act on
         how I think is best and not what I feel is best. I actively try to better understand emotions by observing those around me.</p>
       <p>I try my best to provide an unbiased and honest opinion on any matter. I don't particularly like choosing sides and in that regard I don't
         have much in the way of favourites. </p>
        <p>I put the needs of others before my own almost all the time and I don't distinctively like asking anyone for help for I constantly see
          myelf as a bother interrupting other people would likely have better things to do and personally I don't like taking up people's time
          unless it's of their choice to have me occupy their time.</p>
        <p>I don't have a particularly strong pressence as a person and as such I do my best to try and "blend in" so to say.<br>
        Officially I have zero work experience so make of that as you will.</p>
      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I enjoy reading good books, many people find books boring for some odd reason. Books can break that barrier between fantasy and reality taking
        your mind to somewhere else entirely leaving you in pure awe. Once someone gets immersed in a book its hard to put down. The quality of writing,
        how well the setting is made, character development and story development, all contribute to the quality of the book itself. With the fondness of
        books in mind I have a growing interest in creative writing in order to be a bit more expressive.</p>
      <p>I have spent most of my life on video games, I recall a ridiculous comment from somone once "You have a retard amount of hours on this game
        (Overwatch)", which I still think is hilarious. I was also top 1% in Destiny with a playtime of 4175 hours (174 days). Also to all those gamers
        out there, Dark souls is easy :)</p>
      <p> I have an interest in drawing which I have been slowly picking up on again (I'm still terrible). I also think drawing or art itself is
        expressive in many ways which is why I'm trying it again.</p>
      <p> "Anime is life" some say, but I have an interest in anime because I think it does an excellent job at appealing to one's emotions through story
         telling and screenplay with some doing fantastic jobs at character and world development as it immerses you in that fantasy world, which is on
          par to that of amazing books and novels.</p>
      <p>Music from all genres is also something that I consume for hours on end. It can vastly affect the atmosphere or even change it entirely. Music
        is one of the purest form of expressions out there which is why I'm interested in it personally. Also instrumental music is simply magnificent
         in its own right.</p>
      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <p>My goals are most definitely not mapped out. For the most part I plan on getting better at basically everything I do with no real decision to
      pursue anything in particular at this point in time. It's a matter of finding what I'm best suited for right now if I had to think about it. I
      don't hold any personal desire so advice or a bit of pointing in the right direction is always appreicated.</p>
