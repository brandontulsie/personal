      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>Hello, I'm Brandon Tulsie. Born on September 18th in 1998 and at the current age of 19. <br>As a person I am umempathetic although I try to be
         as empathetic as I possibly can at times, but emotions are hard, this can lead to a lot of social awkwardness, so for the most part I act on
         how I think is best and not what I feel is best. I try my best to provide an unbiased and honest opinion on any matter. I put the needs of
         others before my own as I personally enjoy helping others.<br>
        I don't have a particularly strong pressence as a person and as such I do my best to try and "blend in" so to say.<br>
        Officially I have zero work experience so make of that as you will.</p>
      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I enjoy reading good books, many people find books boring for some odd reason. I have spent most of my life on video games, I recall a ridiculous
      comment from somone once "You have a retard amount of hours on this game (Overwatch)", which I still think is hilarious, I have an interest
      in drawing which I have been slowly picking up on again (I'm still terrible), I was also top 1% in Destiny with a playtime of 4175 hours(174 days).
      Solving puzzles is definitely something I tend to invest a lot of time into as well. "Anime is life" some say, but I have an interest in anime
      because I think it does an excellent job at appealling to one's emotions through story telling and screenplay with some doing fantastic jobs
      at character and world development, which is on par to that of amazing books and novels. I'm also developing a growing interest  in creative
      writing. Music from all genres is also something that I consume for hours on end, instrumental music is simply magnificent.</p>
      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <p>My goals are most definitely not mapped out. For the most part I plan on getting better at basically everything I do with no real decision to
      pursue anything in particular at this point in time. It's a matter of finding what I'm best suited for right now if I had to think about it. I
      don't hold any personal desire so advice is always appreicated.</p>
